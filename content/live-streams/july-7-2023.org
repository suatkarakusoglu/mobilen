* Crafting Minimal Docker Images

https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-system.html

We'll be using the =guix system docker-image= command to produce these images!

I'll keep these examples in the following Codeberg repository:

https://codeberg.org/daviwil/guix-minimal-docker

** Here's what we'll try:

- A minimal Guix container for CI builds (build one from a manifest?)
- Packaging software and services in a Docker container
- Simplifying networking with the =-N= parameter
- Trying it out on Woodpecker CI
