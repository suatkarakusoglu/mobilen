* Trying out Crafted Emacs v2 Beta

Today we'll be trying out the new v2 Beta release of Crafted Emacs, a community-authored Emacs configuration starter kit!

We're joined by Crafted Emacs maintainer Jeff Bowman to discuss the changes and anything else we need to know.

More information can be found in the new README and Jeff Bowman's latest blog post:

Pull it into your own =init.el= file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (load "~/crafted-emacs/modules/crafted-init-config")

#+end_src
