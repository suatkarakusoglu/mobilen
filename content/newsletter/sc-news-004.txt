== Introduction ==

Welcome to the new issue of the System Crafters Newsletter!

It's been a couple of weeks since the last newsletter due to big changes in my
personal life, but now that things are mostly settled, we're back to our regular
publishing schedule.

I also just realized it's been an entire year since I posted a tutorial video
on the System Crafters YouTube channel!  I've been having a lot of fun hacking
on a variety of projects in that time, but I think I'm well overdue for another
video on an interesting topic.

I've got a huge backlog of video ideas to draw from, but if you've got a burning
question that you'd like to see made into a video, please let me know!

                                     -----

     Are you interested in writing a tip or news entry for the newsletter?
    Feel free to send drafts or recommendations to david@systemcrafters.net

== Announcing Crafted Emacs v2 Beta! ==

Jeff Bowman has recently announced the Crafted Emacs v2 Beta release both on
his own blog and Mobilen News:

  -> https://jeffbowman.writeas.com/crafted-emacs-v2-beta
  -> https://systemcrafters.net/news/crafted-emacs-v2-beta

The goal of these changes is to make it easier to adopt Crafted Emacs while
building *your own* Emacs configuration, using only what you need and discarding
it when you no longer need it!

Jeff would love to get feedback on the current direction of the project before
merging it back as the new mainline configuration, so please clone the repo and
check out the `craftedv2beta` branch to give it a try.

  -> https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/tree/craftedv2beta

== Call for Community Projects ==

One thing I've been thinking about for a while is how to activate our community
to collaborate on building new and useful things.  Emacs packages, Guix packages
or configurations, Lisp-authored tools, really anything that would be useful to
a system crafter!

To that end, I've created a new channel on Matrix and IRC for community members
to discuss projects that they would like to collaborate on:

  Matrix: #systemcrafters-hacking:matrix.org / IRC: #systemcrafters-hacking

A few of us are there already discussing a couple of projects that you might be
interested to join:

  - Fade is prototyping a new type of decentralized forum protocol based on NNTP
    and IPFS, written in Common Lisp:

    -> https://codeberg.org/fade/callisto

  - David is doing early work on simplifying Guix configurations in Crafted Guix

    -> https://codeberg.org/SystemCrafters/crafted-guix

If you have your own idea for a project, please feel free to come discuss it
with us!  These projects don't have to be under the "System Crafters" banner,
but if you'd like to make it an official SC project, we can discuss giving you a
repo under the System Crafters org on Codeberg.

I'll be coming up a better community project listing soon so that it's easier
for those interested to contribute to a suitable project.

Even if you don't consider yourself a programmer, if you'd like to contribute to
cool Free Software projects of interest to the community, join us and we'll find
a way for you to help!

== Tip of the Week ==

* Simplified Emacs keymaps in Emacs 29 (and earlier!)

One important part of crafting your own Emacs configuration is defining key
bindings for commands that you use often.  To avoid using `global-set-key` to
bind individual keys under some prefix (like a `C-c o` prefix for Org Mode
commands), you have to learn how to define your own "keymap".

Prior to Emacs 29, the way to do this is to use the `make-sparse-keymap`
function to generate a keymap and then populate it using some initial bindings
with `define-key`, like so:

```
(defvar my/org-key-map
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (define-key map (kbd "a") #'org-agenda)
    (define-key map (kbd "c") #'org-capture)
    (define-key map (kbd "x") #'org-export-dispatch)
    map))
(fset 'my/org-key-map my/org-key-map)

(global-set-key (kbd "C-c o") 'my/org-key-map)
```

This pattern is pretty terrible and basically impossible to remember!  That's
why many people use packages like `use-package`, `general.el` or others to make
it easier to define custom prefix maps.

Luckily the Emacs contributors have solved this problem for us in Emacs 29!  In
this release, we'll get access to a new function called `define-keymap` and a
macro called `defvar-keymap` which make keymap definitions much easier.

Let's re-implement the same keymap definition with `define-keymap`:

```
(global-set-key
 (kbd "C-c o")
 (define-keymap
   :prefix 'my/org-key-map
   "a" 'org-agenda
   "c" 'org-capture
   "x" 'org-export-dispatch))
```

Much cleaner!  In this example, `define-keymap` is defining a new prefix map
called `my/org-key-map` and populating it with the same initial key bindings
that we saw before.  We're also wrapping that call with the `global-set-key` for
`C-c o` because `define-keymap` immediately returns the key map that it creates.

Now what if you want to easily add more key bindings to this map somewhere else
in your configuration?  Use `define-keymap` again!

```
(define-keymap
  :keymap my/org-key-map
  "n n" 'denote
  "n s" 'denote-subdirectory
  "n t" 'denote-type)
```

This example uses the `:keymap` parameter to say that the following bindings
should be added to the `my/org-key-map` that we defined before.

The `define-keymap` function has a few other options that might be interesting
to you so use `C-h f` to read the documentation or check out the source code
here:

  -> https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/lisp/keymap.el#n478

Now let's take a look at the new `defvar-keymap` macro.  It offers the same
functionality as `define-keymap` with a couple of added bonuses:

- It will define a variable for your keymap
- It can also configure repeatable bindings with `repeat-mode`

Here's an example of a window management keymap defined with `defvar-keymap`:

```
;; Make sure repeat-mode is turned on first!
(repeat-mode 1)

(defvar-keymap my/window-key-map
  :doc "Bindings for managing windows, configured to be repeatable."
  :repeat t
  "c" 'delete-window
  "s" 'split-window-horizontally
  "v" 'split-window-vertically
  "h" 'windmove-left
  "j" 'windmove-down
  "k" 'windmove-up
  "l" 'windmove-right
  "C-h" 'shrink-window-horizontally
  "C-j" 'shrink-window
  "C-k" 'enlarge-window
  "C-l" 'enlarge-window-horizontally
  "H" 'windmove-swap-states-left
  "J" 'windmove-swap-states-down
  "K" 'windmove-swap-states-up
  "L" 'windmove-swap-states-right)

(global-set-key (kbd "C-c w") my/window-key-map)
```

The beauty of this keymap is that once you enter it, you can press any of the
keys inside of it as many times as you want!  This makes window navigation,
movement, splitting, and resizing much more efficient because you don't have to
keep pressing the entire key sequence for every action.

Those of you still on Emacs 28 and below might be happy to learn that you don't
need to wait until Emacs 29 to benefit from this new pattern.  These functions
have been added to the `compat` package on GNU ELPA:

https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/doc/compat.html

Once you install this package using `package-install` or any other Emacs package
manager, you can just `require` it to get access to the new keymap functions:

```
(require 'compat)

(global-set-key
 (kbd "C-c o")
 (define-keymap
   :prefix 'my/org-key-map
   "a" 'org-agenda
   "c" 'org-capture
   "x" 'org-export-dispatch))
```

I hope you're as excited about these new functions as I am!

== Crafter News ==

Here are some interesting news items in the broader sphere of system crafting:

* The ultimate guide to software development with Guix

  This really excellent post by Guix founder Ludovic Courtès gives an excellent
  breakdown for how you can use Guix to power your programming projects.

  Not only does it explain how to create a guix.scm file for your repository,
  it also explains how to turn your repository into a Guix channel so that
  other people can try out development builds of your project!

  It even covers using Guix for CI and other useful tasks, so I highly recommend
  checking it out if you're interested to see how Guix can make hacking even
  more awesome.

  -> https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2023/from-development-environments-to-continuous-integrationthe-ultimate-guide-to-software-development-with-guix/

* Read a legendary Lisp book in Emacs

  The book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" is a classic
  entry in computer science literature which teaches the fundamentals of
  computer programming through the lens of the Scheme programming language.

  This blog post by Konstantinos Chousos explains how you can read this book
  and experiment with what you learn all from the comfort of Emacs!

  -> https://kchousos.github.io/posts/sicp-in-emacs/

* A new auth-source backend for 1Password

  The `password-store` program is probably the best Free Software solution for
  managing your passwords and other sensitive information, but what if you need
  to use a proprietary solution like 1Password for work or because you need to
  share passwords with family?

  Traditionally it hasn't been possible to use 1Password entries from within
  Emacs, but now you can!  The new `auth-source-1password` uses the official
  1Password command-line tool `op` to pull your passwords into Emacs for
  authentication with the `auth-source`

  -> https://github.com/dlobraico/auth-source-1password

  It shouldn't require much configuration to use this package as long as you
  already have the `op` tool installed:

  -> https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/

  I haven't had a chance to try this package yet, so let me know what you think
  if you try it out!

  By the way, if you don't much about `auth-source` or using encrypted passwords
  in Emacs, check out this video I made a couple of years ago:

  -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ_T7Q49B8Y

== Friday's Stream - Crafting Streamlined Guix Configurations ==

In tomorrow's stream, we'll discuss some ideas I have for how we can simplify
Guix configurations and share high quality, reusable configuration blocks!

We'll also hack on an example of this to provide a pre-configured Sway desktop
environment that someone can pull into their Guix configuration with a few lines
of code.

The stream will go live at Friday, June 16th at 6PM EEST (UTC+3),
  check your local time on this page: https://time.is/compare/1800_in_Athens
